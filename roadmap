Roadmap

Here's a list of work underway or under consideration:

 Debootstrapping:

  - Translate the reader to Go using goyacc.
  - Translate the compiler to Go.
  - Remove all FASL files from the repo.
  - Consider using the gob format for FASL files.

 Expressiveness:

  - Package system.
  - Concurrency.
  - Local mutual recursion.
  - Delimited continuations.
  - Dynamic scope.
  - Better error-handling mechanisms.

 Pragmatics:

  - Debugger improvements.
  - System libraries for Linux.

 Optimization:

  - Inline ((func ...) ...) and (apply (func ...) ...).
  - Maybe coalesce common instruction sequences for less dispatching.
  - Inline calls to statically-known primitives.
  - Optimize calls to statically-known functions.
